### Additional Features For Future Development

- _Additional form_

  - I would like to include an additional form that would ask the user about their redaing habits. This will help the site gain valuable information about the users reading habits and the user will feel that they are being paid attention to and that their ideas and ability are a valid contribution to the club

- _Interactive Reviews_

  - I would like to have a scrollable review page that allows users to input their review through the page. This wouold include their name and a start rating of the book of the month and their review. This would be visable to all users of the site and would showcase the members of the club and encourage new members to get involved.
