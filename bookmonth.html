            <h3>September</h3>
            <h4>Name: The Constant Rabbit</h4>
            <h5>Author: Jasper Fforde</h5>
            <p>
              England, 2020. There are 1.2 million human-sized rabbits living in
              the UK. They can walk, talk and drive cars, the result of an
              Inexplicable Anthropomorphising Event fifty-five years ago. And a
              family of rabbits is about to move into Much Hemlock, a cosy
              little village where life revolves around summer fetes,
              jam-making, gossipy corner stores, and the oh-so-important Best
              Kept Village awards. No sooner have the rabbits arrived than the
              villagers decide they must depart. But Mrs Constance Rabbit is
              made of sterner stuff, and her family are behind her. Unusually,
              so are their neighbours, long-time residents Peter Knox and his
              daughter Pippa, who soon find that you can be a friend to rabbits
              or humans, but not both. With a blossoming romance, acute cultural
              differences, enforced rehoming to a MegaWarren in Wales, and the
              full power of the ruling United Kingdom Anti Rabbit Party against
              them, Peter and Pippa are about to question everything they'd ever
              thought about their friends, their nation, and their species.
              It'll take a rabbit to teach a human humanity . . .

              Firstly, the cover is beautiful and immediately caught my
              attention. the style of the writing was easy to follow, great font
              and sizing and nice size chapters. The writing is fantastic in its
              ability to broaden ones imagination to create a world where you
              can see the human sized animals Jasper had written when reading.
              He has created his own fantasy universe in such a clever way that
              it almost feels like the story is believable and is something that
              has or could have happened. His cleverness of the way he writes
              politics really helps you to understand the prejudice that happens
              in modern day society.

              I found the book to be a very interesting look at our current and
              historical political climate, whilst maintaining a lighter air of
              fantasy. The world that Jasper Fforde has created exceeded my
              expectations. I found the story to be a quaint yet bitter look at
              the lifestyle of English villages and the bubbling animosity and
              sometimes hatred that can be just under the surface in such
              places. That being said, I was happy to find a silver lining of
              beautifully described relationships and a story that revealed
              itself to be a love letter to the British countryside. I would
              wholeheartedly recommend this book and I will be into this author
              and his extended works with excitement.

              Jasper has a unique style of writing. Unless you are accustomed to
              reading formally written and politically correct books, I would
              say that it is quite a difficult read. Although I enjoyed the
              story, I found that my pace had slowed down and often I had to
              re-read what I had previously read, to make sure that I fully
              understood and appreciated the concept. I adored the characters
              and the ending is beautifully simple, if a little abrupt. I
              wouldn’t necessarily read again but I’m glad to have dipped my toe
              into Ffordes’ universe.
