                    <h2>Name: The Constant Rabbit</h2>
                    <h3>Author: Jasper Fforde</h3>
                    <p>England, 2020.
                    
                    There are 1.2 million human-sized rabbits living in the UK.
                    
                    They can walk, talk and drive cars, the result of an Inexplicable Anthropomorphising Event fifty-five years ago.
                    And a family of rabbits is about to move into Much Hemlock, a cosy little village where life revolves around summer
                    fetes, jam-making, gossipy corner stores, and the oh-so-important Best Kept Village awards.
                    
                    No sooner have the rabbits arrived than the villagers decide they must depart. But Mrs Constance Rabbit is made of
                    sterner stuff, and her family are behind her. Unusually, so are their neighbours, long-time residents Peter Knox and his
                    daughter Pippa, who soon find that you can be a friend to rabbits or humans, but not both.
                    
                    With a blossoming romance, acute cultural differences, enforced rehoming to a MegaWarren in Wales, and the full power of
                    the ruling United Kingdom Anti Rabbit Party against them, Peter and Pippa are about to question everything they'd ever
                    thought about their friends, their nation, and their species.
                    
                    It'll take a rabbit to teach a human humanity . . .</p>
