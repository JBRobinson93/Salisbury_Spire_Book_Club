                    <h2>The History of Salisbury Cathedral</h2>
                    <p>Salisbury Cathedral was founded in 1220 as a response to deteriorating relationships between the clergy and the
                    military. Legend has it that the then Bishop of Old Sarum, having become disillusioned with the garrison in the town,
                    decided he would move the seat of his influence by building a new cathedral. He took up a bow and pledged to found his
                    church wherever the arrow fell, before firing it out of the window. Unbeknown to him, the arrow struck the side of a
                    deer and was carried several miles through the countryside before coming to lie on the site of today’s Cathedral. <br>The building is regarded as one of the leading examples of Early English Gothic architecture. Its main body was
                    completed in 38 years, from 1220 to 1258. The spire was built in 1320. It was heightened to 404 feet (123 m) and has been the tallest church spire in the United
                    Kingdom since 1561.</p>
